# Build-Your-Neural-Network
**Jianguo Zhang, February 5, 2017**

In this project, We build a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership on [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

The program written by [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) 

Run `DNLD1-neural-network.ipynb` or check `DNLD1-neural-network_online_results.html` for online results

**Note:** This project is not difficult, just a start cake for deep learning.
