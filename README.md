# Build-Your-Neural-Network
**Jianguo Zhang, February 5, 2017**

In this project, We build a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership on [Bike Shaing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

**Note** This project is not difficult, just a start cake for deep learning. The program written by [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
